## Binary Trees 
Node contains data and have  pointer to left child also pointer to right child.
Each node, except for the root have at most two child

Big O : O(log(N)) time complexity when you add new item to the tree
## Tries
Tree is a collection of nodes  start with node called the root node as parent node also the longest path from a leaf to the root clled height

Big O : O(h) worst-case runtime complexity H means the height of the tree worst case, O(m) time
## Balancing Binary Trees (AVL Tree)
